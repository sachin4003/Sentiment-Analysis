# Sentiment-Analysis
In this project, I undertook the task of finding public sentiment and emotions towards the "Omicron Variant" of the corona virus by scrutinizing live tweets gathered from Twitter's API. Employing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as text cleaning, stemming, lemmatization, and tokenization using libraries like NLTK and spacy on top of Neural Networks.
Additionally, I employed the TF-IDF Vectorizer, a fundamental tool for transforming text into numerical data, enabling effective modeling.
~FINDINGS:-
-> Preprocessing steps significantly enhanced the quality of the text data, thereby improving the overall 
     performance of the model.
-> The TF-IDF Vectorizer played a crucial role in feature extraction, enabling the neural network to 
     effectively process the text.
